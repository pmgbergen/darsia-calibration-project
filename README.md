# darsia-calibration-project
Analysis and calibration of DarSIA for the use of different pH indicators in FluidFlower experiments.

This repository contains code for the Phys117 project by students H. Skretting and I. Fossdal.
The scripts investigate the sensitivity of the kernel-based concentration analysis with respect to user input based on different FluidFlower experiments.
